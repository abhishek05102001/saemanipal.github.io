					<p>Kraftwagen is an outdoor event at Techtatva and its participants would have to build their own bot which would be tested on a variety of hard terrains ranging from hanging bridges ,uneven rocks and even underwater.</p>
					<p>This event stretches to a span of 2days. Day1 begins at the automobile workshop where participants build their own bot by shaping, cutting and smoothing the edges of a chasis from an aluminium sheet and several motors, wires are connected to this chasis to build a ground breaking bot capable of multi-terrain locomotion. </p>
					<p>Day 2 brings these bots to live ,where all participants control their bot on the harsh terrains in a time bound environment. The participant with the fastest timing wins the grand total from a pool of 12000. The whole experience is electric and also serves an educational purpose to its participants by providing hands on experience.</p>

The event stretches to a span of 2 days. Day 1 is theoretical and various concepts such as lift, drag, wing concepts and a lot more exciting concepts were covered. Further dissection of a jet engine took place in cross section which enabled to view the various parts and functions of different parts. Day 2 begins in the propulsion lab where participants visualised the aeronautical designs from the previous day and ends with the demonstration of a functioning water tunnel used to run aerodynamic tests.  </p>

	    <p>Kraftwagen continues even through the pandemic!<br>
The event which was until last year a completely outdoor event could not be stopped by a mere pandemic. The kraftwagen family stood together and made sure that the name of an event like kraftwagen wont be forgotten by continuous efforts by our managing committee and dedicated volunteers.</p>
<p>The event stretched for 2 days where the first day was where the participants took part in a quiz to earn points or currency to be used in an auction planned for day 2.</p>
<p>Here on the second day was when the real thrill began when people voiced their prices through a sweaty auction for different car parts to make the best version of their car! Being rich was not the only requirement to win here but it was necessary to be smart in your bidding as well. Here after rigorous rounds of bidding and the auction people were finally ready to fabricate their car from the ground up, securing the winning spot to the team having the best version of their automobile providing superior performance.</p>
